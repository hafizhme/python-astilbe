## Why Python?

+++

> The day-to-day work of programming consists not of writing new programs, but mostly reading and modifying existing ones. [Eric S. Raymond](https://www.python.org/success-stories/esr/)

+++

> Many of these projects would not have been possible without the rapid prototyping that is characteristic for Python. [Konrad Hinsen](https://www.python.org/success-stories/mmtk/)

+++

> Python has dramatically improved development processes for the CORE project, and it has led to the faster development times and more rapid releases . . . [Nick Borko](https://www.python.org/success-stories/test-success-story/)
