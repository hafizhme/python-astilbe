## Astilbe

3-loop

## While

+++?code=src/while.py&lang=python

@[](Save as `while.py`)
@[1](Initialize `i = 1`)
@[3]](Condition to execute)
@[4-7](Do you know what these line about?)
@[9](Increment by one)
@[11](Print the latest updated `i`)

---

## Whileelse

+++?code=src/whileelse.py&lang=python

@[](Save as `whileelse.py`)
@[](Or you can modify your previous code.)
@[]
@[11-12](Another code to execute if the condition doesn't met.)

---

## Dowhile

+++

**While do** and **do while** are two different schemes.

+++?code=src/dowhile.py&lang=python

@[](Save as `dowhile.py`)
@[](Or you can modify your previous code.)
@[3](It has to be any `boolean-like` value)
@[3](Any means anything)
@[3](Try to change `True` with `sfkllljsdkl` instead.)
@[4-9](From previous code)
@[11-12](We need to make a condition to exit the loop)
@[11-12](For the sake of *machine health*)
@[12](This is a keyword in python to return from the enclosing loop)

---

## For

+++?code=src/for.py&lang=python

@[](Save as `for.py`)
@[1-5](Spot any difference!)
@[1](Try to print `range(10)` in Python Shell,)
@[1](make it clear by using list casting `list(range(10)).)
@[2-5](The context is like previous code, but we need some changes on it now.)
@[5-7](Variable `i` incremented by `1` automatically from `range()`.)
@[1](Try to define starting value by replace `range(10)` with `range(2,10)`.)
@[1](Try to define stepping value by replace `range(2,10)` with `range(2,10,3)`.)

---

## For

+++?code=src/forlist.py&lang=python

@[](Save as `forlist.py`)
@[1-3](You can loop over list, tupple, even dictionary.)
@[3](You also can specify which element you want to iterate.)
@[3](Remember `my_list[::]`?)
@[](How to iterate from element `2` until end?)
@[3](`my_list[1:]`)
@[](How to iterate from element `2` until element `True` only?)
@[3](`my_list[1:4]`)
@[](How to iterate until element `True` only?)
@[3](`my_list[:4]`)
@[](How to iterate stepping by 2?)
@[3](`my_list[::2]`)

+++

Do you need to get the index of your iteration?

+++?code=src/forenumerate.py&lang=python

@[](Save as `forenumerate.py`)
@[](Actually, there is another way. Please mention!)

---

## Continue

+++?code=src/forcontinue.py&lang=python

@[](Save as `continue.py`)
@[](Absulutely print from `1` to `10`.)
@[](In more complicated manner)
@[4,6](Keyword `str()` used to convert any value to `str`.)
@[4,6](We need them to concatenate `str` by `str`.)
@[8-10](Figure what `continue` here doing)
