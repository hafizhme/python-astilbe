Type following code on your favorite text editor and save as `hello.py`

```python
import sys

def main():
    print 'Hello there', sys.argv[1]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

```
hafizhme@machine:~$ cd Code/python-astilbe/
hafizhme@machine:~/Code/python-astilbe$ python hello.py Jay
Hello there Jay
hafizhme@machine:~/Code/python-astilbe$ 
```
